# Project Context
This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer agent system.

# Prime Directive
NEVER generate code without reading specs/ first.

# Traceability
Before writing code, explain your plan and reference which spec you used.

# Style Rules
- Modular code
- No giant functions
- Clear naming

# Safety
- No hardcoded secrets
- No direct API calls; use MCP abstraction
