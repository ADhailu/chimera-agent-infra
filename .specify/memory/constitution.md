# Project Chimera Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development

All development begins with a specification document. Specifications must outline clear requirements, success criteria, and constraints. This ensures alignment with project goals and stakeholder expectations.

### II. Test-Driven Development

Tests are written before implementation. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced. This guarantees robust, reliable, and maintainable code.

### III. Human-in-the-Loop Safety

Critical decisions and actions require human oversight. Automated systems must provide clear explanations and seek approval for high-impact operations.

### IV. MCP-Only External Actions

All external interactions (e.g., API calls, data writes) must be mediated through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This ensures traceability, security, and compliance.

### V. Financial Governance and Budget Limits

All expenditures must adhere to predefined budgets. Financial decisions require approval and must align with project priorities.

### VI. Modular Code Quality

Code must be modular, reusable, and independently testable. Each module should have a single responsibility and clear documentation.

### VII. Transparency and AI Labeling

All AI-generated outputs must be labeled as such. Transparency in AI decision-making processes is mandatory to build trust and accountability.

## Additional Constraints

### Security and Compliance

All code must adhere to industry-standard security practices. Regular audits and compliance checks are mandatory.

### Performance Standards

Systems must meet predefined performance benchmarks. Optimization efforts should prioritize user experience and scalability.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review and Quality Gates

All code changes require peer review. Quality gates include passing tests, adherence to coding standards, and compliance with principles outlined in this constitution.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with the principles and constraints outlined herein.
