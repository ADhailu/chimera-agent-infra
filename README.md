Project Chimera: Autonomous Influencer Infrastructure
Mission: A governed, multi-agent architecture designed to orchestrate and scale a fleet of autonomous digital influencers with full cognitive and economic agency.
Philosophy: Built on the principle of "Infrastructure > Prompts," this repository utilizes Spec-Driven Development (SDD) to ensure reliable, hallucination-free agent performance.
Architecture: Implements a Hierarchical Swarm pattern (Planner-Worker-Judge) to provide resilient task execution and automated "Management by Exception" governance.
Technology Stack: Leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool connectivity and Coinbase AgentKit for autonomous, on-chain agentic commerce.
Traceability: Integrated with Tenx MCP Sense to provide a "Black Box" flight recorder for every agent decision, ensuring 100% auditable reasoning logs.
